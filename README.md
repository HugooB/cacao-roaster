# README.md template for code repositories


**Note:** This template is provided to give you a good idea about the kind of information you should include in a README.md file as a best practice. You know your project inside-out. Write your readme file for someone who doesn't know anything about it. What do you want people to know about your project who are just coming across it for the first time? OASIS Staff are happy to collaborate with you as well. Further README inspiration can be found [here](https://www.makeareadme.com/) and [here](https://github.com/hackergrrl/art-of-readme#readme).

You may copy and edit this template as you see fit for your project and your community.

## Badges

Using badges is optional, but they are a nice way to show some key facts and stats about your project at a glance. There are badges for all kinds of things relating to your repository, e.g. to show the license you're using, the programming language, the number of forks, or a CI badge to show build/test status. Be mindful not to use too many badges. You can use [Shields](http://shields.io/) to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge. Check out the README of the Open Cybersecurity Alliance project [Kestrel](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-lang) to see badges in action.

## Introduction

* State what problem(s) your project solves.
* Note its development status.
* List the most useful/innovative/noteworthy features.
* Note and briefly describe any key concepts (technical,  philosophical, or both) important to the userâ€™s understanding.
* Link to any supplementary blog posts or project main pages.
* Compare/contrast your project with other, similar projects so the user knows how it is different from those projects.
* Highlight the technical concepts that your project demonstrates or supports. Keep it very brief.
* If possible, include screenshots and demo videos.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

If applicable, list here what is need to install the software and how to install them. Also list any dependencies, if applicable.


### Installation

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## How to run tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With

List any libraries, frameworks or other projects that your code might be using,
for example:

* [Dropwizard](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) - The web framework used
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* [ROME](https://rometools.github.io/rome/) - Used to generate RSS Feeds
